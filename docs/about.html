            <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>

            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>Spider-Man was a change in the typical superhero formula. He's a teenager that expresses doubt in himself, as opposed to many of the other self-assured and confident superheroes that were rising in popularity in the 1960s. This volume specifically showcases both Spider-Man's self-doubt and his fun and quippy dialogue, two features that audiences immediately loved.
            </p>
            <p>There were very few named characters in this volume, and even fewer of them were actually significant, with only 3 of the 5 named characters (counting Peter Parker and Spider-Man as the same character). It's interesting to see that such a fun story had so few characters.
