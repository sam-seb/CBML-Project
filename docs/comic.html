                  They're busy with another case, but they sent the Human Torch to see what he can do! He's speaking at our assembly today!
                  Big deal!

                  Later, at the school assembly...
                   I was asked here to tackle Doctor Octopus. But I've used my flame so much recently,
                  I have to wait a few days to let it get strong again! While I'm waiting, your principal
                  asked me to address you...
                  If only I had his power... his confidence!... But that's wasy when you've never been beaten!

               <div class="panel">
                  Now for a little demonstration! I can't apply my total flame, but here are some fiery
                  figures for you!
                  This is what usually happens when The Thing helps me with my homework! I get results like this!

               <div class="panel">
                  Then, after a few more colorful demonstrations...
                  Now, for a parting thought! Stick to your school work and do your best in your studies!
                  Don't be discouraged if it sometimes seems tough! The important thing is never give
                  up! Remember that-- never give up!
                  
                  <div class="panel">
                     Ability alone isn't enough! It's one lesson I've learned from my partnership with the Fantastic Four!
                     It's almost as though he's talking to me!

                  Even the Fantastic Four have had defeats-- but we always come back! Our motto is never say die!
                  He's right! By golly, he's right!

                  LATER, AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TORCH’S LECTURE...
                  I want to thank you for that speech! I—I’ll never forget what you said today! It meant a lot to me!
                  Huh? Oh, Sure-- sure! Glad you enjoyed it, fella!
